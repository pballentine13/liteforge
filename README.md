# Liteforge

A lightweight and flexible ORM for Go, giving you direct control over your SQL queries and table creation.  Liteforge emphasizes simplicity and transparency, allowing you to define your database schema using Go structs and write raw SQL for maximum control.

## Features

*   **Struct-based Schema:** Define your database tables directly in your Go structs using `db` tags.
*   **Raw SQL:** Write your own SQL queries for CRUD operations and other database interactions. No hidden abstractions or complex query builders.
*   **Lightweight:** Minimal dependencies and a focus on core ORM functionality.
*   **Customizable:** Adapt Liteforge to your specific needs by extending its functionality or integrating with other libraries.
